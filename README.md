Decided to share my pump.fun codebase with the world because: 

1.) There are too many scammers out there on github and telegram.

2.) The IDL for pump.fun isn't public information, but it should be. 

Clone the repo, and add your Public Key (wallet), Private Key and RPC to the Config.py.

Do not change the hard-coded values as they are part of the actual swap instructions for the pump.fun program. 

buy = 16927863322537952870

sell = 12502976635542562355

To see for yourself, decode the "Instruction Raw Data" from any pump fun transaction using the find_instruction.py. 

Contact me if you need help integrating the code into your own project.

Good luck!
